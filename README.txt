Collection of music works: 
This folder includes some of my music works done during my undergraduate years. All songs were composed, arranged, recorded and mixed by myself. Some of the lyrics were written together with others.

Project Ming: 
Project Ming is a Cycling 74 Max prgram that can simulate the sound ambience in ancient Chinese cities. It was written during my time at Berkeley summer school in 2019. It won me a second prize in the Sound Device Show of CSMT 2020. 
Since running the Max program needs a lot of dependent libraries and would be a little complicated, I included a demonstration video in the folder.

Smart Speech System: 
This is a Windows software designed for the telemarketing of a securities company, and also part of my graduate project. It has two main modes: a interface to generate text to speech audio via the connection with a remote server at SJTU, and a tool to join chosen audio files together, while allowing the user to edit those audio files as well as the intervals. 
The entry of the program is at SourceCode/main.exe. Some screenshots of the software GUI are also included.
