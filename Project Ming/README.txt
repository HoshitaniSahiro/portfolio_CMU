Project Ming - by Yuxuan Wu & Xinyue Zhu

Welcome to Project Ming! 
This project is aimed at simulating the sound environment in ancient China using Max. We used odot to put things together and implement the functions. In this ancient town you are where your mouse is. There are algorithms that control the volume and pan of every sound according to the position of the mouse on the screen, so that the whole sound environment can be pretty realistic. Project Ming is of good expansibility as more maps can be easily added in. For demonstration, the city of ancient Nanjing and Wuhan are implemented in two patches here.

Make sure your Max is already installed with the external Odot patches developed by CNMAT, UC Berkeley.

To begin with, open the patch of the city you want to experience. There are four file folders you need to insert: Crowd, Background, Chinastore and Musicstore. Let's just drag them respectively to the corresponding box. And then turn the audio on on the bottom right. 

The jpeg files in the package are pictures that can guide you through the city. Open the picture and make sure it occupies the full screen (but the keyboard can only be activated when Max is in the front).

Try move your mouse on the map, and notice what happens. You can probably hear different human sounds, the river flowing and a musician playing. Move your mouse and feel free to explore. You can walk to the musician and appreciate his playing, or dive into the river to quietly watch time fly.

Try different keys on the keyboard to control the sounds. Press Z to reset the background water flow and music. Press X to set off fireworks (but you may find it noisy if you walk nearby the fireworks). Press C to attend the court (a serious case is just about to go on trial). Press V to make pupils read a poem. And press B to listen to a family enjoying their quiet lunch time. There is a china store and a instrument store. You can play some DIY sounds if you'd like. In the china store, try the Q row on the keyboard to switch the type of china, and try the number row to play different notes. In the instrument store, press key A or S to switch instrument, and press K to start playing random pantatonic music. If you go into a house, you will find the outside world much quieter, but the sound originated in that house is clearer. If you're tired with the noisy city, just walk out and jump into the river, and all sounds will be filtered.

This is just a demonstration. In the future we want to use more complecated maps (which means a lot more calculation) and add more vivid sounds.

Have fun with Project Ming!
